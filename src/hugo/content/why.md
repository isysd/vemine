# Why

Since this organization was inspired by a [Reason Magazine](http://reason.com) [article]((http://reason.com/archives/2016/11/28/the-secret-dangerous-world-of)), let's count the reasons using quotes.

["In more than a dozen interviews, members of the community—some of whom are miners, and others who simply use the currency—described how this technology has alleviated daily hardships, making it possible for them to live reasonably comfortable lives despite the disintegrating society."](http://reason.com/archives/2016/11/28/the-secret-dangerous-world-of)

The suffering and abuse of Venezuelan people is long and well documented. Hope and practical solutions offered by Bitcoin and other open concepts are not yet widely accessible.

Plug and play miners can turn any Venezuelan with electrity and internet into a Bitcoin user, and provide them with a modest financial incentive to learn.

["Many bitcoin users live in constant fear of being discovered and agreed to speak with Reason only on the condition of anonymity."](http://reason.com/archives/2016/11/28/the-secret-dangerous-world-of)

Centralization is dangerous to digital currency users everywhere, and especially in Venezuela.

By using USB miners that would fit in a pocket or an envelope, thousands or tens of thousands can be distributed to a diverse and unique population.

["Many Venezuelans subsist on a monthly government stipend equivalent to about $9."](http://reason.com/archives/2016/11/28/the-secret-dangerous-world-of)

After taking into account Venezuela's lowest in the world electricity rates, the rewards generated by a USB miner could be up to $0.40 per month worth of BTC. This would be a noticable 4.4% income boost for people living on social programs.
