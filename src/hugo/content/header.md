# What
### Distribute usb digital currency miners to Venezuelan people.

Imagine 1 in every 1,000 Venezuelan people mining Bitcoin at home, supplimenting their income with free and unencumbered internet money. This can be achieved with less than the average cryptocurrency ICO raises in its first 24 hours.

# Why

The suffering and abuse of Venezuelan people is long and well documented. Hope and practical solutions offered by Bitcoin and other open concepts are not yet widely accessible.

"In more than a dozen interviews, members of the community—some of whom are miners, and others who simply use the currency—described how this technology has alleviated daily hardships, making it possible for them to live reasonably comfortable lives despite the disintegrating society. *Many bitcoin users live in constant fear of being discovered and agreed to speak with Reason only on the condition of anonymity.*" - [The Secret Dangerous World of Venezuelan Bitcoin Mining, Reason](http://reason.com/archives/2016/11/28/the-secret-dangerous-world-of)

Emphasis added on the last sentence to show how dangerous centralization is to the Venezuelan digital currency users. Cheap and easy to distribute USB miners can make any Venezuelan into a Bitcoin user, and the small rewards generated make a big difference in a country where [$20/mo is the average salary](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-06/monthly-salary-of-20-shows-why-venezuelans-wait-in-food-lines), $1 worth of mining rewards goes a long way.

# How
